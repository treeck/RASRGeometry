Proving that abstract sets of ordered combinations (n-tuples) imply the
Euclidean volume equation and some distance equations, including the inner
product and Euclidean distance equations, provides a foundation for:
1) a proof that a combinatorial (permutation) property of distance limits
distance to 3 dimensions (other dimensions are members of different sets),
2) derivations of gravity, charge, electromagnetic, relativity, and quantum
physics equations and constants,
3) adding quantum extensions to classical and relativity equations.
All the proofs are verified in Rocq.
