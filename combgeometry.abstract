Euclidean volume and the Minkowski distances are derived from sets of n-tuples.
A commutative property limits distance to a set of 3 dimensions.
Therefore, other compact and continuous dimensions have different types (are
members of different sets), with unit-factoring ratios of a distance unit to
units of other types (time, mass, and charge).
The geometry proofs and ratios are used to derive the gravity, charge,
permitivity, Planck, and fine structure constants, and used to provide simple
derivations of some well-known classical gravity and charge equations, special
and general relativity equations, and quantum physics equations.
All the proofs are verified in Coq.
