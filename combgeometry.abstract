Proving the Euclidean volume equation and some distance equations, including
the inner product and Euclidean distance, are instances of abstract sets of
ordered combinations (n-tuples) provides a foundation for:
1) a proof that a combinatorial (permutation) property of distance limits
distance to 3 dimensions (other dimensions are members of different sets),
2) short and simple derivations of gravity, charge, electromagnetic,
relativity, and quantum physics equations and constants,
3) adding quantum extensions to classical and relativity equations.
All the proofs are verified in Rocq.
