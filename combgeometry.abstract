Countable distance and volume set mappings between sets of size c
infinitesimals of domain and range intervals generate the properties of metric
space, the Lp norms (for example, Manhattan and Euclidean distance), and the
volume equation as c goes to zero.
The volume and Euclidean distance proofs used to provide simpler and more
rigorous derivations of Newton's gravity force, Coulomb's charge force, the
spacetime, and some general relativity equations.
A symmetry property of distance and volume can limit distance and volume to
3 dimensions.
All proofs are verified in Coq.
